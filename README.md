# 👋 Hey there, I'm Mayank!

I'm a curious student + beginner web developer who loves building things that make my own life easier (and hopefully help others too 🚀).  
Right now, I'm exploring **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Python** – and enjoying every little "aha!" moment along the way.  

---

## 🌱 What I'm learning
- Frontend with React ⚛️  
- Backend with Node.js 🍃  
- Playing around with Python 🐍 (making small tools for fun!)  
- And of course... how to tinker with AI. 😅  

---

## 🛠️ Some things I've built
✨ Instead of just listing repos, here’s the story behind them:

- **🎓 AttenX** – College attendance was confusing, so I built my own tracker. Simple React app, deployed on Netlify. Now I *finally* know when to bunk and when not to. Take a look at it - [AttenX](https://attenx.netlify.app/) 😉  

- **🤖 VidyaMitra** – An AI-powered career guidance site for Indian students.  
  Not just another chatbot! You can search any career field, get detailed info + resources (from IIT JEE prep to Web Dev to AI/ML skills).  
  Built with React (frontend), Node.js (backend), Gemini AI API, deployed with Vercel & Render. [VidyaMitra]([https://attenx.netlify.app/](https://vidya-mitra-frontend-eta.vercel.app/))

- **🐍 Python mini-tools** – My Python journey started with small scripts and tools. Nothing crazy, but every little program taught me something new.

## 💡 My vibe
- 🚀 I like experimenting and learning by *building*  
- 🎨 Keeping things fun, simple, and not too serious  
- 🌍 Open-sourcing my projects so others can learn from my beginner mistakes 😅
